OpenStack Command Line


SYNOPSIS
========

:program:`openstack` [<global-options>] <command> [<command-arguments>]

:program:`openstack help` <command>

:program:`openstack` :option:`--help`


DESCRIPTION
===========

:program:`openstack` provides a common command-line interface to OpenStack APIs.  It is generally
equivalent to the CLIs provided by the OpenStack project client libraries, but with
a distinct and consistent command structure.


AUTHENTICATION METHODS
======================

:program:`openstack` uses a similar authentication scheme as the OpenStack project CLIs, with
the credential information supplied either as environment variables or as options on the
command line.  The primary difference is the use of 'project' in the name of the options
``OS_PROJECT_NAME``/``OS_PROJECT_ID`` over the old tenant-based names.

::

    export OS_AUTH_URL=<url-to-openstack-identity>
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=<project-name>
    export OS_USERNAME=<user-name>
    export OS_PASSWORD=<password>  # (optional)

:program:`openstack` can use different types of authentication plugins provided by the keystoneclient library. The following default plugins are available:

* ``token``: Authentication with a token
* ``password``: Authentication with a username and a password
* ``openid`` : Authentication using the protocol OpenID Connect

Refer to the keystoneclient library documentation for more details about these plugins and their options, and for a complete list of available plugins.
Please bear in mind that some plugins might not support all of the functionalities of :program:`openstack`; for example the v3unscopedsaml plugin can deliver only unscoped tokens, some commands might not be available through this authentication method.

Additionally, it is possible to use Keystone's service token to authenticate, by setting the options :option:`--os-token` and :option:`--os-url` (or the environment variables :envvar:`OS_TOKEN` and :envvar:`OS_URL` respectively). This method takes precedence over authentication plugins.

.. NOTE::
    To use the ``v3unscopedsaml`` method, the lxml package will need to be installed.

AUTHENTICATION USING FEDERATION
-------------------------------

To use federated authentication, your configuration file needs the following:

::

    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=<project-name>
    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=<project-domain-name>
    export OS_AUTH_URL=<url-to-openstack-identity>
    export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    export OS_AUTH_PLUGIN=openid
    export OS_AUTH_TYPE=v3oidcpassword
    export OS_USERNAME=<username-in-idp>
    export OS_PASSWORD=<password-in-idp>
    export OS_IDENTITY_PROVIDER=<the-desired-idp>
    export OS_CLIENT_ID=<the-client-id-configured-in-the-idp>
    export OS_CLIENT_SECRET=<the-client-secred-configured-in-the-idp>
    export OS_OPENID_SCOPE=<the-scopes-of-desired-attributes-to-claim-from-idp>
    export OS_PROTOCOL=<the-protocol-used-in-the-apache2-oidc-proxy>
    export OS_ACCESS_TOKEN_TYPE=<the-access-token-type-used-by-your-idp>
    export OS_DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT=<the-well-known-endpoint-of-the-idp>
    export OS_ACCESS_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=<the-idp-access-token-url>


OPTIONS
=======

:program:`openstack` takes global options that control overall behaviour and command-specific options that control the command operation.  Most global options have a corresponding environment variable that may also be used to set the value. If both are present, the command-line option takes priority. The environment variable names are derived from the option name by dropping the leading dashes ('--'), converting each embedded dash ('-') to an underscore ('_'), and converting to upper case.

:program:`openstack` recognizes the following global options:

.. option:: --os-cloud <cloud-name>

    :program:`openstack` will look for a ``clouds.yaml`` file that contains
    a cloud configuration to use for authentication.  See CLOUD CONFIGURATION
    below for more information.

.. option::  --os-auth-type <auth-type>

    The authentication plugin type to use when connecting to the Identity service.

    If this option is not set, :program:`openstack` will attempt to guess the
    authentication method to use based on the other options.

    If this option is set, its version must match
    :option:`--os-identity-api-version`

.. option:: --os-auth-url <auth-url>

    Authentication URL

.. option:: --os-url <service-url>

    Service URL, when using a service token for authentication

.. option:: --os-domain-name <auth-domain-name>

    Domain-level authorization scope (by name)

.. option:: --os-domain-id <auth-domain-id>

    Domain-level authorization scope (by ID)

.. option:: --os-project-name <auth-project-name>

    Project-level authentication scope (by name)

.. option:: --os-project-id <auth-project-id>

    Project-level authentication scope (by ID)

.. option:: --os-project-domain-name <auth-project-domain-name>

    Domain name containing project

    Domain name containing user

.. option:: --os-user-domain-id <auth-user-domain-id>

    Domain ID containing user

.. option:: --os-trust-id <trust-id>

    ID of the trust to use as a trustee user

.. option:: --os-default-domain <auth-domain>

    Default domain ID (Default: 'default')

.. option:: --os-XXXX-api-version <XXXX-api-version>

    Additional API version options will be available depending on the installed
    API libraries.

.. option:: --os-interface <interface>

    Interface type. Valid options are `public`, `admin` and `internal`.

.. NOTE::
    If you switch to openstackclient from project specified clients, like:
    novaclient, neutronclient and so on, please use `--os-interface` instead of
    `--os-endpoint-type`.

.. option:: --os-profile <hmac-key>

    This key should be the value of one of the HMAC keys defined in the
    configuration files of OpenStack services to be traced.

.. option:: --os-beta-command

    Enable beta commands which are subject to change

.. option:: --log-file <LOGFILE>

    Specify a file to log output. Disabled by default.

COMMANDS
========

To get a list of the available commands::

    openstack --help

To get a description of a specific command::

    openstack help <command>

Note that the set of commands shown will vary depending on the API versions
that are in effect at that time.  For example, to force the display of the
Identity v3 commands::

    openstack --os-identity-api-version 3 --help

.. option:: complete

    Print the bash completion functions for the current command set.

.. option:: help <command>

    Print help for an individual command

Additional information on the OpenStackClient command structure and arguments
is available in the `OpenStackClient Commands`_ wiki page.

.. _`OpenStackClient Commands`: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackClient/Commands

Command Objects
---------------

The list of command objects is growing longer with the addition of OpenStack
project support.  The object names may consist of multiple words to compose a
unique name.  Occasionally when multiple APIs have a common name with common
overlapping purposes there will be options to select which object to use, or
the API resources will be merged, as in the ``quota`` object that has options
referring to both Compute and Block Storage quotas.

Command Actions
---------------

The actions used by OpenStackClient are defined with specific meaning to provide a consistent behavior for each object.  Some actions have logical opposite actions, and those pairs will always match for any object that uses them.


CLOUD CONFIGURATION
===================

Working with multiple clouds can be simplified by keeping the configuration
information for those clouds in a local file.  :program:`openstack` supports
using a ``clouds.yaml`` configuration file.

Config Files
------------

:program:`openstack` will look for a file called clouds.yaml in the following
locations:

* Current Directory
* ~/.config/openstack
* /etc/openstack

The first file found wins.

The keys match the :program:`openstack` global options but without the
``--os-`` prefix:

::

    clouds:
      devstack:
        auth:
          auth_url: http://192.168.122.10:5000/
          project_name: demo
          username: demo
          password: 0penstack
        region_name: RegionOne
      ds-admin:
        auth:
          auth_url: http://192.168.122.10:5000/
          project_name: admin
          username: admin
          password: 0penstack
        region_name: RegionOne
      infra:
        cloud: rackspace
        auth:
          project_id: 275610
          username: openstack
          password: xyzpdq!lazydog
        region_name: DFW,ORD,IAD

In the above example, the ``auth_url`` for the ``rackspace`` cloud is taken
from :file:`clouds-public.yaml`:

::

    public-clouds:
      rackspace:
        auth:
          auth_url: 'https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/'

Authentication Settings
-----------------------

OpenStackClient uses the Keystone authentication plugins so the required
auth settings are not always known until the authentication type is
selected.  :program:`openstack` will attempt to detect a couple of common
auth types based on the arguments passed in or found in the configuration
file, but if those are incomplete it may be impossible to know which
auth type is intended.  The :option:`--os-auth-type` option can always be
used to force a specific type.

When :option:`--os-token` and :option:`--os-url` are both present the
``token_endpoint`` auth type is selected automatically.  If
:option:`--os-auth-url` and :option:`--os-username` are present ``password``
auth type is selected.

Logging Settings
----------------

:program:`openstack` can record the operation history by logging settings
in configuration file. Recording the user operation, it can identify the
change of the resource and it becomes useful information for troubleshooting.

See :ref:`configuration` about Logging Settings for more details.


NOTES
=====

The command list displayed in help output reflects the API versions selected.  For
example, to see Identity v3 commands ``OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION`` must be set to ``3``.


EXAMPLES
========

Show the detailed information for server ``appweb01``::

    openstack \
        --os-project-name ExampleCo \
        --os-username demo --os-password secret \
        --os-auth-url http://localhost:5000:/v2.0 \
        server show appweb01

The same but using openid to authenticate in keystone::

    openstack \
        --os-project-name ExampleCo \
        --os-auth-url http://localhost:5000:/v2.0 \
        --os-auth-plugin openid \
        --os-auth-type v3oidcpassword \
        --os-username demo-idp \
        --os-password secret-idp \
        --os-identity-provider google \
        --os-client-id the-id-assigned-to-keystone-in-google \
        --os-client-secret 3315162f-2b28-4809-9369-cb54730ac837 \
        --os-openid-scope 'openid email profile'\
        --os-protocol openid \
        --os-access-token-type access_token \
        --os-discovery-endpoint https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration \
        server show appweb01

The same command if the auth environment variables (:envvar:`OS_AUTH_URL`, :envvar:`OS_PROJECT_NAME`,
:envvar:`OS_USERNAME`, :envvar:`OS_PASSWORD`) are set::

    openstack server show appweb01

Create a new image::

    openstack image create \
        --disk-format=qcow2 \
        --container-format=bare \
        --public \
        --copy-from http://somewhere.net/foo.img \
        foo


FILES
=====

:file:`~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml`
    Configuration file used by the :option:`--os-cloud` global option.

:file:`~/.config/openstack/clouds-public.yaml`
    Configuration file containing public cloud provider information such as
    authentication URLs and service definitions.  The contents of this file
    should be public and sharable.  ``clouds.yaml`` may contain references
    to clouds defined here as shortcuts.

:file:`~/.openstack`
    Placeholder for future local state directory.  This directory is intended to be shared among multiple OpenStack-related applications; contents are namespaced with an identifier for the app that owns it.  Shared contents (such as :file:`~/.openstack/cache`) have no prefix and the contents must be portable.
