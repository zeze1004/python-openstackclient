network flavor profile
======================

A **network flavor profile** allows administrators to create, delete, list,
show and update network service profile, which details a framework to enable
operators to configure and users to select from different abstract
representations of a service implementation in the Networking service.
It decouples the logical configuration from its instantiation enabling
operators to create user options according to deployment needs.
