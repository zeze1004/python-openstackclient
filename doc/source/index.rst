brings the command set for Compute, Identity, Image, Object Storage and
Block Storage APIs together in a single shell with a uniform command
structure.

Project Goals
-------------

* Use the OpenStack Python API libraries, extending or replacing them as required
* Use a consistent naming and structure for commands and arguments
* Provide consistent output formats with optional machine parseable formats
* Use a single-binary approach that also contains an embedded shell that can execute
  multiple commands on a single authentication (see libvirt's virsh for an example)
* Independence from the OpenStack project names; only API names are referenced (to
  the extent possible)
