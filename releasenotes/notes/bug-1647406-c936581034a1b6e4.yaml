    Allow ``--block-device-mapping`` option to work correctly with
    ``--volume`` option in ``server create`` command.
    After :lpbug:`1383338` ``--block-device-mapping`` was ignored if
    ``--volume`` was present. Block device mappings are now appended
    to the mapping created by the ``--volume`` option if it is present.
    The device name of the boot volume specificed in the ``--volume`` option
    is no longer assumed to be *'vda'* but now uses the hypervisor's boot
    index to obtain the device name.  This maintains the status quo for
    **QEMU/KVM** hypervisors but **XEN**, **parallels** and others 
    *virt types* that have device naming is different from ``vd*``
    should now also work correctly.
