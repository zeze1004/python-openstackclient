    Added support for Volume API v3 for the following block storage command
    resources: ``consistency group``, ``consistency group snapshot``,
    ``volume``, ``volume backup``, ``volume host``, ``volume snapshot``,
    ``volume type``, ``volume qos``, ``volume service``,
    ``volume transfer request``. Note that microversion support for Volume API
    v3 is not yet implemented, each command will assume the API version is
    ``3.0``.
