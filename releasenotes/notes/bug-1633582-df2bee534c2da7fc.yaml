deprecations:
  - |
    ``volume transfer request accept`` has been changed to move the ``auth-key``
    positional argument to a required option ``--auth-key``.  This leaves
    the transfer request ID as the only positional argument, as per the
    OpenStackClient command format.  The old format is still functional, but is
    deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix ``volume transfer request accept`` to not fail the transfer request
    name/ID lookup for non-admin users as the Volume API does not allow non-admin
    users access to transfers in other projects.
    [Bug `1633582 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-openstackclient/+bug/1633582>`_]
  - |
    Change the output column order in ``volume transfer request list`` to have
    ``ID`` followed by ``Name`` then the remaining columns.
