    Added support for `microversion 2.89`_. This microversion removes the
    ``id`` field while adding the ``attachment_id`` and ``bdm_uuid`` fields to
    the responses of ``GET /servers/{server_id}/os-volume_attachments`` and
    ``GET /servers/{server_id}/os-volume_attachments/{volume_id}`` with these
    changes reflected in novaclient under the ``openstack server volume list``
    command.
