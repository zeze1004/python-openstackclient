    Add ``any`` as a ``--protocol`` option to ``security group rule create``
    command.

fixes:
  - |
    It is now possible to create a security rule without specifying protocol
    (using ``--protocol any``), which skips sending the protocol to the API
    server entirely. Previously TCP was forced as default protocol when none
    was specified.
