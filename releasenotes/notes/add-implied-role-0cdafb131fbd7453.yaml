    Support for creating, deleting, and listing implied roles has been added.
    This allows users to create an inference rule between two roles. The
    first, called the prior role is the role explicitly assigned to an
    individual. The second, called the implied role, is one that the user
    is assgined implicitly.  Additionally, these rules can be chained, such
    that an implied role from the first inference rule can be the implied role
    in the second.  Thus one explicitly assigned role can lead to multiple
    implied roles.
    ``implied role create <role> --implied-role <implied-role>`` creates an
    association between prior and implied roles.
    ``implied role delete <role> --implied-role <implied-role>`` removes an
    association between prior and implied roles.
    ``implied role list`` Lists all implied roles that currently exist.
