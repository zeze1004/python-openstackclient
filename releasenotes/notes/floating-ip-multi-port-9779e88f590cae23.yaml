    The ``openstack server add floating ip`` command has been fixed to handle
    servers with multiple ports attached. Previously, the command was using
    the first port in the port list when attempting to associate the floating
    ip. This could fail if the server had multiple ports and the first port
    in the list was not attached to an external gateway. Another way it could
    fail is if the ``--fixed-ip-address`` option was passed and the first port
    did not have the specified fixed IP address attached to it.
    Now, the ``openstack server add floating ip`` command will find the port
    attached to the specified ``--fixed-ip-address``, if provided, else it will
    try multiple ports until one is found attached to an external gateway. If
    a suitable port is not found in the port list, an error will be returned.
