    Add ``--project`` and ``--project-domain`` options to ``volume type set``
    and ``volume type unset`` commands

    Use the ``--project`` option to restrict a volume type to a specific project.
    Volume types are public by default, restricted volume types should be made
    private with the ``--private`` option to the ``volume create`` command.
