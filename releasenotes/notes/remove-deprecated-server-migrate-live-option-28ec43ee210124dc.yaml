    The deprecated ``--live`` option of the ``server migrate`` command has
    been removed. This was problematic as it required a host argument and
    would result in a forced live migration to a host, bypassing the
    scheduler. It has been replaced by a ``--live-migration`` option and
    optional ``--host`` option.
