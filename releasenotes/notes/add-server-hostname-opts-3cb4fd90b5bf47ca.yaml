    The ``server create``, ``server set`` and ``server rebuild`` commands now
    accept an optional ``--hostname HOSTNAME`` option. This can be used to
    configure the hostname stored in the metadata service and/or config drive.
    Utilities such as ``cloud-init`` can then consume this information to set
    the hostname within the guest OS.
