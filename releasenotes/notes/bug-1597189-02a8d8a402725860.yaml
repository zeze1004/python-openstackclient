    The ``volume`` argument of the ``volume backup restore`` command is now
    optional and can refer to the name of a new volume that should be created
    rather than a name or ID of an existing volume (which would be
    overwritten). If not provided, cinder will generate a new volume with a
    unique name. To restore a backup to an existing volume, you must now
    specify the ``--force`` option (volume v2, v3 only).
