    Add ``--name-lookup-one-by-one`` option to the ``server list`` command
    that is (mutually exclusive with ``-n | --no-name-lookup``).
    When provided, the names of images and flavors will be resolved one by one
    only for those images and flavors that are needed to display the obtained
    list of servers instead of fetching all the images and flavors.
    Depending on amount of images in your deployment this can speed up the
    execution of this command.
  - |
    When given ``--image`` or ``--flavor`` argument, the ``server list``
    command now resolves only single image or flavor instead of fetching
    all the images or flavors for name lookup purposes.
