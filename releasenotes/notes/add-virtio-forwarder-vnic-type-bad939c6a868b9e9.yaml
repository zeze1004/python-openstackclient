    The ``virtio-forwarder`` VNIC type has been added as another option for
    setting the ``--vnic-type`` property on the ``port set`` and
    ``port create`` commands. This requests a low-latency virtio port inside
    the instance, likely backed by hardware acceleration. Currently the
    Agilio OVS external plugin provides support for this, with support from
    other vendors following soon.
