    Change column name ``Display Name`` to ``Name`` in ``volume list`` output.
    Current ``volume list --name`` command uses ``display_name`` as search_opts
    to send to cinder API, and show the result table with ``Display Name``
    as column title. Replace all ``Display Name`` by ``Name`` to be consistent
    with other list commands.

    Support a mapping for volume list -c ``Display Name`` (Volume v1 and v2)
    and volume create/show -c ``display_name`` (Volume v1) to maintain backward
    compatibility until the next major release.
