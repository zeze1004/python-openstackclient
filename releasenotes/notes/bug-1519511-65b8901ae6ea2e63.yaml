features:
  - The ``security group create``, ``security group set`` and
    ``security group show`` commands now uses Network v2 when
    enabled which results in a more detailed output for network
    security group rules.
    [Bug `1519511 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1519511>`_]
fixes:
  - The ``security group create`` command now uses Network v2 when
    enabled which allows the security group description to be created
    with an empty value. In addition, the ``tenant_id`` field changed
    to ``project_id`` to match the ``security group show`` command
    output.
