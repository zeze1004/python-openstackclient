features:
  - |
    Add new commands ``router add route`` and ``router remove route`` to
    support new Neutron extension: ``extraroute-atomic`` (see `Neutron RFE
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1826396>`_).
deprecations:
  - |
    The use of ``router set --route`` to add extra routes next to already
    existing extra routes is deprecated in favor of ``router add route
    --route``, because ``router set --route`` if used from multiple clients
    concurrently may lead to lost updates.
