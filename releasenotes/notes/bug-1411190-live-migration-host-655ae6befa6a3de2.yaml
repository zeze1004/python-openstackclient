deprecations:
  - |
    The ``--live`` option on the ``openstack server migrate`` command has
    been deprecated and is being replaced with two new options:

    * ``--live-migration``: This will signal that the migration is a live
      migration.
    * ``--host``: This can be used to request a target host for the live
      migration but requires ``--os-compute-api-version`` 2.30 or greater
      so the requested host can be validated by the scheduler.

    The ``--live`` option is problematic in that it requires a host and
    prior to compute API version 2.30, specifying a host during live migration
    will bypass validation by the scheduler which could result in failures to
    actually migrate the server to the specified host or over-subscribe the
    host.

    The ``--live`` and ``--host`` options are mutually exclusive. Furthermore,
    if both the ``--live`` and ``--live-migration`` options are used the
    ``--live-migration`` option takes priority.

    ``--host`` option to the ``openstack server migrate`` command.
