    A warning will now be emitted when using the ``--disk-overcommit``
    or ``--no-disk-overcommit`` flags of the ``server migrate`` command on
    Compute API microversion 2.25 or greater. This feature is only supported
    before this microversion and previously the flag was silently ignored on
    newer microversions. This warning will become an error in a future
    release.
