upgrade:
  - With the change to use keystoneauth plugins the OpenStackClient-specific
    ``osc_password`` authentication plugin has been removed.  The visible
    difference should only be in the behaviour with poorly configured clouds
    with old default Keystone values for admin_endpoint and public_endpoint
    as seen in the version details returned in a GET to the root ('/') route.
