features:
  - |
    Add a number of additional options to the ``server create`` command:

    - ``--snapshot``
    - ``--ephemeral``
    - ``--swap``
    - ``--block-device``
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``--block-device-mapping`` option of the ``server create`` command
    has been deprecated in favour of ``--block-device``. The format of the
    ``--block-device-mapping`` option is based on the limited "BDM v1"
    format for block device maps introduced way back in the v1 nova API. The
    ``--block-device`` option instead exposes the richer key-value based
    "BDM v2" format.
