    Add support for compute API microversion 2.47, which changes how flavor
    details are included in server detail responses. In 2.46 and below,
    only the flavor ID was shown in the server detail response. Starting in
    2.47, flavor information is embedded in the server response. The newer
    behavior is now supported.
