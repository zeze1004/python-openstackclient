    OSprofiler support was added. To initiate OpenStack request tracing
    ``--profile <HMAC_KEY>`` option needs to be added to the CLI command. This
    key needs to present one of the secret keys defined in the OpenStack
    projects configuration files (if there is a wish to generate cross-project
    trace, the chosen key needs to be presented in all these configuration
    files). By default all OpenStack projects, that support OSprofiler,
    are using ``SECRET_KEY`` HMAC key.

    To use tracing functionality OSprofiler (and its storage backend)
    needs to be installed in the environment. If so, you will be able to
    trigger profiling via `openstack --profile SECRET_KEY <operation>` command.
    At the end of output there will be message with <trace_id>, and to plot
    human-readable HTML chart the following command should be used -
    ``osprofiler trace show <trace_id> --html --out result.html``.
