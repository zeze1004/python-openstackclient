features:
  - |
    By default listing security group rules now shows the direction.
    The ``--long`` argument is now redundant and is now ignored as it
    was only used to display the direction.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecate the ``--long`` option for the ``security group list``
    command. This is no longer needed to display all columns.
