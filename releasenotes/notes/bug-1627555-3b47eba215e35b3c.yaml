    The ``project list`` command lists all projects when called by an
    admin user.  For non-admin users it will now list projects for the
    authenticated user instead of exiting with an authorization failure.
    The ``--my-projects`` option has also been added to the ``project list``
    command to allow admin users to list their own projects.
