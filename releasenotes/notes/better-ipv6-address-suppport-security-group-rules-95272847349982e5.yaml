features:
  - |
    Add ``--ethertype`` option to ``security group rule list`` command.
    Valid values are ``ipv4`` and ``ipv6``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Security group rule listings now have the ``Ethertype`` field displayed
    by default to more easily differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6 rules.
    In addition, the ``IP Range`` field of a security group will be
    changed to ``0.0.0.0/0`` for IPv4 and ``::/0`` for IPv6 if no
    value is returned for the address, based on the Ethertype field of
    the rule. For further information see
