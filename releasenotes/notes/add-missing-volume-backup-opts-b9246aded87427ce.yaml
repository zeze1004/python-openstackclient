features:
  - |
    Add ``--no-incremental``, ``--property`` and ``--availability-zone``
    options to ``volume backup create`` command, allowing users to request a
    non-incremental backup, set a metadata property on the created backup, and
    set an availability zone on the created backup, respectively.
  - |
    Add ``--property`` and ``--no-property`` options to the
    ``volume backup set`` command to set a metadata property or remove all
    metadata properties from an existing backup.
  - |
    Add new ``volume backup unset`` command to allow unsetting of properties
    from an existing volume backup.
fixes:
  - |
    The ``--name`` and ``--description`` options of the ``volume backup set``
    command will now verify the version requested on the client side.
    Previously this would fail on the server side.
