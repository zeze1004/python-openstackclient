deprecations:
  - |
    The ``--project`` and ``--user`` options for the ``volume create``
    command have been deprecated. They are deprecated because Cinder's
    volume create API ignores the corresponding API inputs.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix ``volume create`` by removing two broken options. The ``--project``
    and ``--user`` options were intended to specify an alternate project
    and/or user for the volume, but the Volume service's API does not
    support this behavior. This caused the volume to be created, but
    without the expected project/user values. However, an alternate
    project and/or user may be specified using identity overrides (e.g.
    --os-username, --os-project-id).
