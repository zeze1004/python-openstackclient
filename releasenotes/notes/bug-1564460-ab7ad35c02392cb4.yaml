fixes:
  - Fixed the ``--route`` option on the ``router set`` command
    which did not properly format the new routes to set resulting
    in a ``Bad Request`` error. In addition, the ``router create``,
    ``router list`` and ``router show`` command output for routes
    was fixed to improve readability and to align with the
    ``--route`` option on the ``router set`` command.
