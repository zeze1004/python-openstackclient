features:
  - |
    Allow ``--no-fixed-ip`` and ``--no-binding-profile`` options to
    ``port set`` command to be specified when ``--fixed-ip`` and
    ``--binding-profile`` are present.  This allows the list of fixed
    IPs and binding profiles to be cleared and replaced with new values
    in a single command.
    [Blueprint  `allow-overwrite-set-options <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/python-openstackclient/+spec/allow-overwrite-set-options>`_]
  - |
    Add ``--no-allocation-pool`` and ``--no-host-route`` options to
    ``subnet set`` command that clears the respective values in the
    specified subnet.  This allows new values to replace the entire
    list of existing values in a single command for allocation pools
    and host routes.
